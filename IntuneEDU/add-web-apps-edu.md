# Add web apps to Intune for Education  

Add web apps to your Intune for Education inventory. After you've added the apps, you can [assign them to groups](install-apps.md) and install them to your Windows 10 or iOS devices.

Students access this kind of app in a browser, such as Microsoft Edge or Safari. Students access web apps by clicking a link that you send to their devices. On a Windows 10 device, Links appear in the **Start** menu. On an iOS device, links appear as web clips on the main app screen.

1. Sign in to the Intune for Education portal.
2. Click **Apps**.
3. From the app list, under **WEB APPS**, click **New app**.
4. In the **New web app** section, enter the following details:
   * **URL** — The URL of the app that you want to assign.
   * **App name** — The display name for the app in the **Start** menu on student devices.
   * **Icon** — Upload a PNG or JPG file to use as the app's icon.

  ![Add a new web app page, which prompts users for the information described in the procedure below.](./media/apps-001-add-webapp.png)
