# Delete apps from Intune for Education 
Delete an app from your Intune tenant. When you delete an app, it is removed from group assignments *and* uninstalled from devices.  

To assign the app again, you will need to add it back to your Intune tenant through the App Store.  

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Office desktop apps and VPP token apps cannot be deleted. To remove these from a device or user, change its group assignment.

1. From the Intune for Education dashboard, click **Apps**.
2. Go to the app list, and under **iOS Apps** click the app that you want to delete.
3. Click **Delete App**.
4. Click **Delete** to confirm your action.
